# customer segmentation analysis

## Project Overview
The project initiates by setting up a Transaction_Data table to house transactional details, importing data from a CSV file. It then focuses on segmenting German customers utilizing the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis method. Segmentation is categorized into four groups: 'Best Customers', 'Loyal Customers', 'Potential Loyalists', and 'Regular Customers', based on their RFM scores. SQL queries are employed to compute RFM scores and assign customers to respective segments. This segmentation enables tailored marketing strategies and enhances customer engagement approaches. Through this analysis, businesses can better understand customer behavior, leading to improved marketing tactics and increased customer satisfaction, ultimately fostering business growth and success.
